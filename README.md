The FreeMealApp is a client-side front-end web development project created for the final exam submission in the Client-side Front-End Development course at Swiss German University by Aldi Putra, Hansel Zorya Ashero, and Winston Narada Kusumahadi.

## Executive Summary
The project utilizes Firebase for user login and the themealdb API to search for recipes along with ingredients and instructions. Localstorage is implemented to save the user's search history.

## Project Roles
- Aldi Putra: FreeMeal API Connect (Search Bar), Showing Ingredients and Descriptions, Localstorage
- Hansel Zorya Ashero: UI Web Design, Firebase Login with Google Account
- Winston Narada Kusumahadi: Firebase Login with Google Account, Localstorage, FreeMeal API Connect (Sort by Letters)

## Project Implementation
The team created the web app using React, integrated Firebase for authentication, and utilized the themealdb API for recipe information. They implemented local storage to save user search history. The project involved creating React components, setting up Firebase configuration, and designing the user interface. The login functionality was implemented using Google Account authentication.

## Challenges and Solutions
1. **The Initial Codes Didn't Work:**
   - The team faced issues with localstorage and Firebase working on different devices. Merging both sets of code and resolving conflicts led to a functional Meal App.

2. **React Router DOM Properties Unreadable:**
   - Challenges arose with React Router DOM not reading properties of the map variable. The team resolved this by iterating through API elements individually to ensure proper functioning.

3. **Outdated Firebase:**
   - The team encountered errors related to Firebase dependencies while installing react-router-dom. Uninstalling, reinstalling, and updating Firebase resolved the issue, allowing for successful installation of react-router-dom.
